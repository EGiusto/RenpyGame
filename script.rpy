Abigail "Hello! My name is Abigail Cooper and welcome to my story!"
Abigail "I am 16 years old and live in a nice house with my mom and dad."
#show mom?
Abigail "My mom’s name is Shannon, and she has always been there for me no matter what. \nShe is a stay at home mom and is my best friend and my teacher! I am currently homeschooled so she gives me all the lessons and knowledge I need to know. \nShe’s great!"
#show dad?
Abigail "My dad’s name is Jerry, and he is my second best friend! \nHe works as a mechanic and works super long hours. Even though he is always away at work all day, he still manages to find time to spend with me, he’s the best!"

Abigail "I have no idea where I would be without my parents; they’re amazing. They’ve always been my best friends and all I’ve ever needed. They’ve always spent time with me and played dress up when I was a little kid and play video games with me ALL THE TIME! \nThey are so fun! I love spending time with them!"
#show crime?
Abigail "You see, the world out there is a super super scary and dangerous place. Even though I’m young, I know ALL about it. All about all the problems with the world; all the robberies, murder, destruction, pollution, violence and more. \nThere are lots of scary men and women out there who don’t care about anyone but themselves, all they care about is killing and destroying every last bit of happiness from everyone."
Abigail "Thats why I stay inside my house. My mom and dad have always made sure I know EVERYTHING about the world around me and they warn me and make sure I never have to ever go outside and get hurt."
Abigail "My dad always leaves to go to work and when he gets back he looks so exhausted, but he always puts a great face on for me, and I know he always looks like that because the awful people in this world are draining his happiness, but he always feels better when he comes home to me and my mom."
Abigail "My mom is usually staying at home with me, but when she does have to leave, I make sure to greet her with the biggest hug when she gets back every time, because I know she needs it after the dangers she went through just to get the ingredients for dinner."

Abigail "Of course I love my family and I love my life and I know that I am much better off inside my safe home than I am outside in that dangerous world with unimaginable tortures at every step.. but I can’t help but wonder.. what would it be like out there? With real friends and people my age? Even though I always have my mom and my dad to talk to, I crave interaction with people my age, with people who might understand how I am feeling and talk about all the ways we can fix the outside so that way kids like me can go out there for ourselves." 
Abigail "My mom tells me every other kid is also homeschooled, which makes me think that they must be lonely sometimes too. I wish I could meet one of them.. I wish I had friends."
