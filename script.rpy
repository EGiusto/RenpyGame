#intro scene

Abigail "Hello! My name is Abigail Cooper and welcome to my story!"
Abigail "I am 16 years old and live in a nice house with my mom and dad."
#show mom?
Abigail "My mom’s name is Shannon, and she has always been there for me no matter what. \nShe is a stay at home mom and is my best friend and my teacher! I am currently homeschooled so she gives me all the lessons and knowledge I need to know. \nShe’s great!"
#show dad?
Abigail "My dad’s name is Jerry, and he is my second best friend! \nHe works as a mechanic and works super long hours. Even though he is always away at work all day, he still manages to find time to spend with me, he’s the best!"

Abigail "I have no idea where I would be without my parents; they’re amazing. They’ve always been my best friends and all I’ve ever needed. They’ve always spent time with me and played dress up when I was a little kid and play video games with me ALL THE TIME! \nThey are so fun! I love spending time with them!"
#show crime?
Abigail "You see, the world out there is a super super scary and dangerous place. Even though I’m young, I know ALL about it. All about all the problems with the world; all the robberies, murder, destruction, pollution, violence and more. \nThere are lots of scary men and women out there who don’t care about anyone but themselves, all they care about is killing and destroying every last bit of happiness from everyone."
Abigail "Thats why I stay inside my house. My mom and dad have always made sure I know EVERYTHING about the world around me and they warn me and make sure I never have to ever go outside and get hurt."
Abigail "My dad always leaves to go to work and when he gets back he looks so exhausted, but he always puts a great face on for me, and I know he always looks like that because the awful people in this world are draining his happiness, but he always feels better when he comes home to me and my mom."
Abigail "My mom is usually staying at home with me, but when she does have to leave, I make sure to greet her with the biggest hug when she gets back every time, because I know she needs it after the dangers she went through just to get the ingredients for dinner."

Abigail "Of course I love my family and I love my life and I know that I am much better off inside my safe home than I am outside in that dangerous world with unimaginable tortures at every step.. but I can’t help but wonder.. what would it be like out there? With real friends and people my age? Even though I always have my mom and my dad to talk to, I crave interaction with people my age, with people who might understand how I am feeling and talk about all the ways we can fix the outside so that way kids like me can go out there for ourselves." 
Abigail "My mom tells me every other kid is also homeschooled, which makes me think that they must be lonely sometimes too. I wish I could meet one of them.. I wish I had friends." 


#filler scene 
Abigail "I sit in my room as I finish the last of one of my homework assignments. The schoolwork I have to do is usually very easy, so it tends to take up very little of my time."

Shannon “Abigail?”

Abigail "I hear my mom call my name as she walks into my bedroom. “Hey mom! “What’s up?” 

Shannon “I was wondering if you wanted to watch a movie with me before I go to the store for tonight’s dinner?” 

Abigail “Oh yeah sure! What movie?” My mom and I love watching old Disney movies together, it’s our favorite genre and we’ve watched all of the Disney movies at least ten times each. My favorite has to be either tangled or the little mermaid."

Shannon “Let’s watch your favorite! Tangled!”

Abigail “Awesome okay!” 
Abigail "I follow my mom downstairs to the couch in our living room. We sit beside each other on the couch and grab a blanket to share. I snuggle in close and get comfy as my mom starts the movie."
Abigail "I’ve always loved the movie tangled because it gives me hope. Rapunzel, the main character in the movie, is just like me! Her mom protects her from the scary outside world and Rapunzel has never wanted to leave, just always dreamed about seeing the world around her. The only difference between her and me is that her mom turns out to be evil, and I know my mom isn’t."
Abigail "This movie has always just made me feel happy to watch, besides the evil mom part, because it makes me feel like eventually the world will be okay enough for me to go and explore the things that I’ve been dreaming about my entire life. I’ve always wanted to watch a sunset, or look at the night sky; I love drawing the sky in my free time, but it sucks that I’ve never been able to see it in real life." 
Abigail "Maybe one day, just like Rapunzel, I’ll be able to go outside and have my dream of seeing the sky and the ground and the rain and everything I’ve never experienced, and maybe if I’m lucky, it’ll be with a friend my age by my side." 

#time skip 
—— 

Abigail "The movie ends and my mom turns the tv off." 

Shannon “That was fun, that movie never gets old."

Abigail “I agree! It will forever be one of my favorites! /nThanks for watching it with me.”

Shannon “Anytime sweetie, but now I have to go to the store to get the things I need for dinner, how does shrimp Alfredo sound?” 

Abigail “Oooo that sounds amazing! Yes please!” 

Shannon “Okay perfect, well I’ll be back in an hour max.” 
Abigail "My mom gets off of the couch and makes her way to the door. 

Abigail “Okay mom! See you soon!” 

Shannon “Bye sweetie!”

#time skip

Abigail "It is currently 4:00, my dad doesn’t get home until around 6:00 so my mom will most likely have dinner ready by then, so I have about 2 hours to myself." 
Abigail "While I love my parents and spending time with them, I also really value my alone time. I love to paint, bake, draw, play video games, read and more." 
Abigail "My favorite activity might be video games, but the problem is, I’m only allowed to play single player. I know what you’re thinking, just play an online game while they’re gone, rebel a little, make some friends like I’ve been so badly wanting my entire life."
Abigail "Well.. I can’t. My parents have the internet disabled except for during my “school hours” which is only a four hour window where my mom is by my side the entire time. I get it, they don’t want me to be tracked and then kidnapped or get our house broken into, I rarely ever see them use the internet either besides for our subscriptions. They have a lot of specific configurations for our internet so that way it keeps me safe and I won’t have to maybe find a disturbing video online, but they can still use it for us to watch movies and tv shows, which are also limited."
Abigail "Now while I do love my old Disney movies so so so much, I kinda wish I could watch some other things. I don’t have much of a selection, in order to keep me safe from all the graphic things that’s on the tv duh obviously, but it’s still really annoying sometimes. Sometimes I wish I was allowed to be a normal kid ya know, like I know all kids are living the same or a similar life to me, but some kids have less strict parents and sometimes I wish mine would let up a little bit from time to time."
Abigail "But that’s okay, I know they’re only doing what’s best for me because they love me, and I am very grateful for them."
Abigail "Besides, I can find plenty of fun things to do in my free time. For example, I love love love playing pretend, even if I am sixteen, I have a very graphic imagination. I usually let out all my crazy ideas by writing or by acting them out, like a drama play."
Abigail "I decide that that’s what I’m going to do while my mom is gone at the store!"
Abigail "I run into my closet and take out the closest thing I can find to a pirate outfit and put it on. I look very funny, but that’s the fun of it!"
Abigail "Alright! Now that I’ve got the outfit, let’s make a map!"
Abigail "I sit at my desk and take out a blank sheet of paper, I quickly draw a map of my house in 2D; it has the kitchen, the living room, the office, and then my room, and my parents room. I mark a giant X on my parents room and put away my drawing utensils." 
Abigail "Man, times like this I really wish I had a friend to do this with…"
Abigail "I jump up from my desk chair."
Abigail “ARGG!” 
Abigail "I shout as I run around my house, ‘searching for my treasure’."
Abigail "Eventually I make it to my parents door after a long trek through the ‘Abigail Gulf’, the seas I took my boat through until I finally made it to where the legend says the treasure lies." 
Abigail "I open my parents bedroom door and walk into their bedroom. My parents have a desk, and a bed in their room. They don’t mind when I come into their room, sometimes I hangout in here with them, we’re all just that close to each other."
Abigail "I start to make my way to their walk in closet with my best pirate voice, “legend says the treasure lies right beneath my nose!” 
Abigail "I dodge all the ‘traps’ in their room and make it into their closet, pushing past all of their clothing that I pretend is vines."
Abigail "While I move their clothes side to side, I run my hands across the walls of the side of their closet." 
Abigail “Treasure! Treasure! Where are you?”
Abigail "I stop dead in my tracks as my hand runs across a tiny door." 
Abigail “What is this?” 
Abigail "I ask myself, snapping out of my fantasy. I move all of the clothes away from where my hand stopped to reveal a small trapdoor, like those that lead to an attic." 
Abigail "That’s weird. I don’t remember this being here."
Abigail "I open the hidden trapdoor and it reveals a tiny attic area with lots and lots of boxes." 
Abigail "Oh, this is probably where my parents keep all the storage. Duh, that’s why I’ve never seen it." 
Abigail "I step through the door and into the attic and look around. Yup, lots of boxes labeled living room, kitchen, etc. This must just be where they keep all the extra supplies for each room from when we first moved into this house. This is a neat place. I look around and find a box labeled ‘Abigail’."
Abigail "That’s weird, ooo maybe some of my really old baby pictures are in there!"
Abigail "I’ve always asked my mom and dad to see old baby pictures of me but they always say they don’t want to dig around for them, this is probably why."
Abigail "I wouldn’t wanna dig around in this attic place either, it looks like there’s spiders everywhere!"
Abigail "I go into the box and search for those pictures I’ve been wanting to see. I move some things around, paperwork, pictures of my mom and dad, but none of me. That’s weird."
Abigail "I finally get to the bottom of the box and see a small picture peeking through the dozens of papers also at the bottom of the box. It’s a picture of me, it looks like I’m three, maybe four years old. Im standing, wearing a little white dress with a blue bow in my hair and smiling. I look adorable!"
Abigail "I move the papers blocking the picture and finally grab a hold on the picture and hold it out in front of me."
Abigail "My face immediately goes pale as I look at the picture that’s now a piece of paper. My eyes widen as I stare at it in complete disbelief."

#not sure how to make it so abigail isnt saying it but it shows
"Above the picture of happy toddler me, is a headline:"

"MISSING"

Abigail "what is going on?"

#CHOICE SCENE

Abigail “I look at the missing poster of toddler me, trying to wrack my brain of what this means.”
Abigail “Am I missing? Was I missing? What does this mean?”
Abigail “I have no idea what to do. I have no idea who I am.”
Abigail “I take a deep breath and try to collect my thoughts.” 
Abigail “Okay let’s just, leave this here so my parents don’t know I was here and let’s just go back in my room and take a moment to think of what is going on.”
Abigail “As I put the missing child poster back into the box, I hear the front door open.”

Shannon “Hi sweetie! I’m home!” 

Abigail “Uh oh. I quickly close the trapdoor and run out of my parents room, closing all of the doors behind me to make sure it looks like I was never there. “
Abigail “Hi mom! One second, let me change my clothes really quick!” 
Abigail “I yell down to my mom as I try my best not to freak out. “

Shannon “Okay sweetie, your dad will be home soon, I’ll go ahead and start dinner!” 

Abigail “I change my clothes and sit on my bed for a second, taking a couple deep breaths and collecting myself.”
Abigail “Was that even a picture of me?”

Abigail “I think back to the picture, the grey eyes, the dark brown hair, the wide dimpled smile.”
Abigail “That was definitely a picture of me. It looked just like me.”
Abigail “So I went missing when I was four years old. Am I still missing? Did my parents find me and they just kept that for memories? That’s really weird if they kept that for memories.”
Abigail “Is that why my parents would never let me see baby pictures of me?”
Abigail “This is so confusing and it doesn’t help that I don’t remember anything from before I was four. I just remember this house and my mom and my dad.”
Abigail “Are they even my mom and dad?”
Abigail “Oh my god, is this why I’m never allowed out of the house?”
Abigail “What if the world isn’t that bad at all?!”
Abigail “Okay okay calm down again. My parents have never given me a reason not to trust them, let’s just think.”

Shannon “Abigail! Dinner!” 

Abigail “What?! Already? I check the time, 6:14. I’ve been sitting on my bed thinking for so long my mom already finished dinner and my dad already came home.”
Abigail “Coming!” “I slowly make my way downstairs.”

Jerry “Hey there kiddo,” 

Abigail “My dad smiles at me as he sits at the dinner table, looking exhausted like always.”

Jerry “I was beginning to think you didn’t wanna see me, you’ve been up in your room ever since I got home.”

Shannon “Ever since even I got home,” my mom chimed in.”

Abigail “Oh sorry, I was uh, reading a book and I was at a really good part and I just wanted to try and finish before it was time to eat.” “I say, quickly coming up with an excuse.”

Shannon “I thought you said you had to change?” 

Abigail “Shoot. “Oh yeah, I did that too. I was trying on different clothes while you were gone,” I say, avoiding eye contact as I slip into a chair at the table.”

Shannon “Well sounds like you had a fun time while I was at the store.” 

Abigail “My mom smiles as she puts the food down in front of us.”
Abigail “That’s one way to put it.”
Jerry “This looks great Shannon!” 
Abigail “My dad lights up as he takes a bite.”

Abigail “Thanks mom.” I smile as I take a bite too.”
Abigail “We all eat quietly as my thoughts run wild again.”
Abigail “There are two options:”
Abigail “Either my parents are really my parents and I went missing when I was a young child and my mom and dad eventually found me and kept that poster in their room just to have it. That would explain why they never let me leave the house, they never want me to disappear again, they’re scared. Then that would mean the world truly is as awful and dangerous as they say, and I experienced that trauma first hand.”
Abigail “Or, I’ve been missing ever since I was four and my parents are my kidnappers. That’s why they never let me leave the house, because they don’t want anybody finding me and they want to keep me forever. That missing poster was a copy of many that they probably tried to take down so no one would look for me anymore.”
Abigail “I don’t know which one is real.”
Abigail “I want to ask my parents for help. They’ve always been here for me. I never do anything without them, and especially make such a huge decision without them.”
Abigail “But if they’re my kidnappers, they would know that I know, and that would be really awful.”

Shannon “Abigail? Is everything okay? You look deep in thought over there.” 

Abigail “What should I do?”

#CHOICE !!!!!! Hide what you know. Ask parents. !!!!!!!
